Repo for demo idea, and code for ICT720 course 2025. 
People with mobility impairments, especially wheelchair users, often face challenges in controlling home appliances and monitoring their daily activity. This project aims to create a smart environment that enhances accessibility, convenience, and safety using M5Capsule, T-SIM camera, Raspberry Pi, and Tapo smart plug.
The system works by tracking the wheelchair user’s motion and detecting their proximity to automate appliance control and provide activity monitoring. When the user moves, the M5Capsule transmits motion data via Wi-Fi to a server, allowing caregivers to monitor their daily movement patterns. Additionally, a T-SIM camera detects the wheelchair’s Bluetooth signal and sends commands to a Raspberry Pi, which controls a Tapo smart plug to turn on or off appliances like lights, fans, or TVs.

## User Stories
1. As a **<ins>wheelchair user</ins>**, I want my **motion data to be tracked and stored** on a server so that I can monitor my daily activity and caregivers can check for unusual patterns.
2. As a **<ins>wheelchair user</ins>**, I want **smart appliances (lights, fan, TV, etc.) to turn on automatically** when I enter a room so that I don’t have to manually control them.
3. As a **<ins>wheelchair user</ins>**, I want the **system to turn off appliances automatically** when I leave a room so that I can save energy and reduce fire hazards.
4. As a **<ins>caregiver</ins>**, I want to **receive an alert if the wheelchair user** has been inactive for too long so that I can check on their well-being.
5. As a **<ins>wheelchair user</ins>**, I want to be **able to manually turn appliances on/off** via a smartphone app so that I have control when needed.
